Tyrrell Rockafellar, Xuegang, Ban | Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten", allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to "unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven traffic TSEP. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17984v1 |

Edwards, Bamin Khomami | Currently, identification of crystallization pathways in polymers is being carried out using molecular simulation-based data on a preset cut-off point on a single order parameter (OP) to define nucleated or crystallized regions. Aside from sensitivity to cut-off, each of these OPs introduces its own systematic biases. In this study, an integrated machine learning workflow is presented to accurately quantify crystallinity in polymeric systems using atomistic molecular dynamics data. Each atom is represented by a high-dimensional feature vector that combines geometric, thermodynamic-like, and symmetry-based descriptors. Low dimensional embeddings are employed to expose latent structural fingerprints within atomic environments. Subsequently, unsupervised clustering on the embeddings identified crystalline and amorphous atoms with high fidelity. After generating high quality labels with multidimensional data, we use supervised learning techniques to identify a minimal set of order parameters that can fully capture this label. Various tests were conducted to reduce the feature set, demonstrating that using only three order parameters is sufficient to recreate the crystallization labels. Based on these observed OPs, the crystallinity index (C-index) is defined as the logistic regression model's probability of crystallinity, remaining bimodal throughout the process and achieving over 0.98 classification performance (AUC). Notably, a model trained on one or a few snapshots enables efficient on-the-fly computation of crystallinity. Lastly, we demonstrate how the optimal C-index fit evolves during various stages of crystallization, supporting the hypothesis that entropy dominates early nucleation, while symmetry gains relevance later. This workflow provides a data-driven strategy for OP selection and a metric to monitor structural transformations in large-scale polymer simulations. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17980v1 |
|     3 | {"pass_filter":false,"exclude_reason":"single-modality tabular learning","raw_score":0,"norm_score":0,"reason":"Excluded: single-modality tabular learning"} | SIFOTL: A Principled, Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization   Method for Tabular Learning | Shubham Mohole, Sainyam Galhotra | Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a significant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially those focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise from complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose SIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular Learning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii) employs twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with assistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted decision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift. Unlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for LLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe summary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel dataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of 0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and statistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy. Furthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM, SIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with injected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from 0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable, privacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17979v1 |

Recent work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn). | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17977v1 |

While the personalization of dynamic concepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single video, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning, limiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs, enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without any test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and consistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and editing scenarios. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17963v1 |
