Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built for real-time speech synthesis and on-device use cases. By scaling train-time compute and applying a sequential process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech with low latency, and support 11 languages with fine-grained emotional control and non-verbal vocalizations through audio markups. We additionally open-source our training and modeling code under an MIT license. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21138v1 |

However, most existing approaches are single-modality: camera-based methods lack depth information, while LiDAR-based methods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods primarily rely on the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline, which suffers from inaccurate depth estimation and fails to fully exploit the geometric and semantic information of 3D LiDAR points. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal occupancy prediction network called SDG-OCC, which incorporates a joint semantic and depth-guided view transformation coupled with a fusion-to-occupancy-driven active distillation. The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth distributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through diffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active distillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and selectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified regions. Finally, for optimal performance, we introduce SDG-Fusion, which uses fusion alone, and SDG-KL, which integrates both fusion and distillation for faster inference. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with real-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable performance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. The code will be released at https://github.com/DzpLab/SDGOCC. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17083v1 |

However, existing vision-language models, such as CLIP, face key challenges in e-commerce recommendation systems: 1) Weak object-level alignment, where global image embeddings fail to capture fine-grained product attributes, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance; 2) Ambiguous textual representations, where product descriptions often lack contextual clarity, affecting cross-modal matching; and 3) Domain mismatch, as generic vision-language models may not generalize well to e-commerce-specific data. To address these limitations, we propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances textual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach significantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness, and recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by 15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%. Additional experimental results show that our framework outperforms vision-language models, including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL, in both precision and semantic alignment, demonstrating the potential of combining object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation for robust multimodal recommendations. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17080v1 |

To ensure LLMs do not assist with harmful requests, safety alignment fine-tuning is necessary in the post-training phase. However, safety alignment fine-tuning has recently been shown to significantly degrade reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as the "Safety Tax". In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets effectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning capabilities. This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a low-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights. Our extensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding show that this approach produces highly safe LLMs -- with safety levels comparable to full-model fine-tuning -- without compromising their reasoning abilities. Additionally, we observe that LoRA induces weight updates with smaller overlap with the initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning. We also explore methods that further reduce such overlap -- via regularization or during weight merging -- and observe some improvement on certain tasks. We hope this result motivates designing approaches that yield more consistent improvements in the reasoning-safety trade-off. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17075v1 |

However, a critical question remains: How robust are DRL models when exposed to adversarial attacks? While existing defense mechanisms such as adversarial training and distillation enhance the resilience of DRL models, there remains a significant research gap regarding the integration of multiple defenses in autonomous driving scenarios specifically. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel ensemble-based defense architecture to mitigate adversarial attacks in autonomous driving. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed architecture significantly enhances the robustness of DRL models. Compared to the baseline under FGSM attacks, our ensemble method improves the mean reward from 5.87 to 18.38 (over 213% increase) and reduces the mean collision rate from 0.50 to 0.09 (an 82% decrease) in the highway scenario and merge scenario, outperforming all standalone defense strategies. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17070v1 |
