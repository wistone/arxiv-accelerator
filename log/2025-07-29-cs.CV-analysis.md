Brown, Michal R. Kazmierski, Valerie J. Pasquarella, William J. Rucklidge, Masha Samsikova, Chenhui Zhang, Evan Shelhamer, Estefania Lahera, Olivia Wiles, Simon Ilyushchenko, Noel Gorelick, Lihui Lydia Zhang, Sophia Alj, Emily Schechter, Sean Askay, Oliver Guinan, Rebecca Moore, Alexis Boukouvalas, Pushmeet Kohli | Unprecedented volumes of Earth observation data are continually collected around the world, but high-quality labels remain scarce given the effort required to make physical measurements and observations. This has led to considerable investment in bespoke modeling efforts translating sparse labels into maps. Here we introduce AlphaEarth Foundations, an embedding field model yielding a highly general, geospatial representation that assimilates spatial, temporal, and measurement contexts across multiple sources, enabling accurate and efficient production of maps and monitoring systems from local to global scales. The embeddings generated by AlphaEarth Foundations are the only to consistently outperform all previous featurization approaches tested on a diverse set of mapping evaluations without re-training. We will release a dataset of global, annual, analysis-ready embedding field layers from 2017 through 2024. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22291v1 |

Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on problem solving, our approach centres on understanding student solutions, identifying mistakes, and assigning grades according to fixed criteria. We compile 122 scanned solutions from the Russian Unified State Exam (EGE) together with official expert grades, and evaluate seven modern VLMs from Google, OpenAI, Arcee AI, and Alibaba Cloud in three inference modes. The results reveal current limitations in mathematical reasoning and human-rubric alignment, opening new research avenues in AI-assisted assessment.

Traditional diagnostic workflows, however, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and resource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and interpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature extraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration of handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep convolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our model to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features from retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark datasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for Glaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates consistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for binary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the IC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\% accuracy, 94.8\% precision, and 94.5 AUC, outperforming several state-of-the-art models. For Glaucoma detection on ORIGA, our model achieves 83.9\% accuracy and 87.2 AUC, showing competitive performance despite dataset limitations. We show, through comprehensive appendix studies, the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features. The model's lightweight and interpretable design makes it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results position HOG-CNN as a robust and scalable tool for automated retinal disease screening. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22274v1 |

Xing, Guangyi Chen, Kun Zhang | Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\citep{radford2021learning} has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual representations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on certain downstream tasks involving short prompts.   In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only \emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also \emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification theory.

However, these methods rely on costly data collection and labor-intensive ground truth labeling to train deep models. Furthermore, autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in unrehearsed, unstructured environments where no labeled data exists and semantic categories may be ambiguous or domain-specific. Recent zero-shot approaches to unsupervised segmentation have shown promise in such settings but typically operate on individual frames, lacking temporal consistency-a critical property for robust perception in unstructured environments. To address this gap we introduce Frontier-Seg, a method for temporally consistent unsupervised segmentation of terrain from mobile robot video streams. Frontier-Seg clusters superpixel-level features extracted from foundation model backbones-specifically DINOv2-and enforces temporal consistency across frames to identify persistent terrain boundaries or frontiers without human supervision. We evaluate Frontier-Seg on a diverse set of benchmark datasets-including RUGD and RELLIS-3D-demonstrating its ability to perform unsupervised segmentation across unstructured off-road environments. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22194v1 |

Piffer, J. A. Buchner, A. G. Gennari, P. Grehten, S. Sirin, E. Ross, I. Ezhov, M. Rosier, J. C. Peeken, M. Piraud, B. Menze, A. Guerreiro Stücklin, A. Jakab, F. Kofler | Background Brain tumours are the most common solid malignancies in children, encompassing diverse histological, molecular subtypes and imaging features and outcomes. Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade gliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation offers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across heterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A retrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG, medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI sequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual annotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT), T2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D nnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation performance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared against intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust performance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator variability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean DSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by tumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2 alone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL is feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and CC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement. These findings support the potential for protocol simplification and automation to enhance volumetric assessment and streamline paediatric neuro-oncology workflows. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22152v1 |

In this paper, we pioneer an innovative viewpoint on few-shot learning by simulating human color perception mechanisms. We propose the ColorSense Learner, a bio-inspired meta-learning framework that capitalizes on inter-channel feature extraction and interactive learning. By strategically emphasizing distinct color information across different channels, our approach effectively filters irrelevant features while capturing discriminative characteristics. Color information represents the most intuitive visual feature, yet conventional meta-learning methods have predominantly neglected this aspect, focusing instead on abstract feature differentiation across categories. Our framework bridges the gap via synergistic color-channel interactions, enabling better intra-class commonality extraction and larger inter-class differences. Furthermore, we introduce a meta-distiller based on knowledge distillation, ColorSense Distiller, which incorporates prior teacher knowledge to augment the student network's meta-learning capacity. We've conducted comprehensive coarse/fine-grained and cross-domain experiments on eleven few-shot benchmarks for validation. Numerous experiments reveal that our methods have extremely strong generalization ability, robustness, and transferability, and effortless handle few-shot classification from the perspective of color perception. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22136v2 |

Despite its importance, label placement remains largely manual and difficult to scale, as existing automated systems struggle to integrate cartographic conventions, adapt to context, or interpret labeling instructions. In this work, we introduce a new paradigm for automatic label placement (ALP) that formulates the task as a data editing problem and leverages large language models (LLMs) for context-aware spatial annotation. To support this direction, we curate MAPLE, the first known benchmarking dataset for evaluating ALP on real-world maps, encompassing diverse landmark types and label placement annotations from open-source data. Our method retrieves labeling guidelines relevant to each landmark type leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrates them into prompts, and employs instruction-tuned LLMs to generate ideal label coordinates. We evaluate four open-source LLMs on MAPLE, analyzing both overall performance and generalization across different types of landmarks. This includes both zero-shot and instruction-tuned performance. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by structured prompts and domain-specific retrieval, can learn to perform accurate spatial edits, aligning the generated outputs with expert cartographic standards. Overall, our work presents a scalable framework for AI-assisted map finishing and demonstrates the potential of foundation models in structured data editing tasks.

Although CLIP is successfully trained on billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2) the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in LLMs. Here, we present Meta CLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, Meta CLIP 2 ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%, and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with 64.3% on image-to-text retrieval. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22062v2 |

However, these sectors face considerable challenges, including climate variability, resource limitations, and the need for sustainable management. Addressing these issues requires efficient, accurate, and scalable technological solutions, highlighting the importance of artificial intelligence (AI). This survey presents a systematic and thorough review of more than 200 research works covering conventional machine learning approaches, advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., vision transformers), and recent vision-language foundation models (e.g., CLIP) in the agriculture domain, focusing on diverse tasks such as crop disease detection, livestock health management, and aquatic species monitoring. We further cover major implementation challenges such as data variability and experimental aspects: datasets, performance evaluation metrics, and geographical focus. We finish the survey by discussing potential open research directions emphasizing the need for multimodal data integration, efficient edge-device deployment, and domain-adaptable AI models for diverse farming environments.

Existing FSVOS datasets and methods typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid foundation for future research in this direction. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22061v1 |

However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have rarely been explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained quantification of these trade-offs, and (2) the use of a single metric for multiple dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in Image Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics, Content, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity, and Bias), contains 40,200 samples, and covers 132 pairwise dimensional subsets. Furthermore, we develop TRIGScore, a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various dimensions. Based on TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore, we evaluate 14 models across T2I and I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System to generate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) that visualizes the trade-offs among model-specific capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently provides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for each type of generative model. Notably, we show that the model's dimension-specific weaknesses can be mitigated through fine-tuning on DTM to enhance overall performance.

Shah, Bardia Safaei, Shameema Sikder, S. Swaroop Vedula, Vishal M. Patel | Active learning (AL) can reduce annotation costs in surgical video analysis while maintaining model performance. However, traditional AL methods, developed for images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition due to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These methods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is ineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the entire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active learning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step recognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which leverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within each video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination prioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step compositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets (Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms existing active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step recognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for efficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing computer-assisted surgical systems. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22059v1 |

Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22058v1 |

Lyu | Physics Engines (PEs) are fundamental software frameworks that simulate physical interactions in applications ranging from entertainment to safety-critical systems. Despite their importance, PEs suffer from physics failures, deviations from expected physical behaviors that can compromise software reliability, degrade user experience, and potentially cause critical failures in autonomous vehicles or medical robotics. Current testing approaches for PE-based software are inadequate, typically requiring white-box access and focusing on crash detection rather than semantically complex physics failures. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study characterizing physics failures in PE-based software. We investigate three research questions addressing the manifestations of physics failures, the effectiveness of detection techniques, and developer perceptions of current detection practices. Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of physics failure manifestations; (2) a comprehensive evaluation of detection methods including deep learning, prompt-based techniques, and large multimodal models; and (3) actionable insights from developer experiences for improving detection approaches.

In this paper, we have proposed an efficient original method for few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning (MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural networks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color space and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can facilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For sufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on four coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four cross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with one-shot sample per class. Overall, all experiments have demonstrated that our MetaLab can approach 99\% $\uparrow\downarrow$ accuracy, reaching the human recognition ceiling with little visual deviation. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22057v1 |

The system features two key components: CLIP3R, a CLIP-informed 3D reconstruction module that predicts dense point maps from overlapping clips while embedding object-level semantics; and 2D-3D OVS, a 2D-3D open-vocabulary semantic module that lifts 2D features into 3D by learning fused descriptors integrating spatial, geometric, and semantic cues. Unlike prior methods, Ov3R incorporates CLIP semantics directly into the reconstruction process, enabling globally consistent geometry and fine-grained semantic alignment. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both dense 3D reconstruction and open-vocabulary 3D segmentation, marking a step forward toward real-time, semantics-aware Spatial AI. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22052v1 |

Nonetheless, shallower deep backbones such as ConvNet-4, are not commonly preferred because they're prone to extract a larger quantity of non-abstract visual attributes. In this paper, we initially re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks. Relevant experiments have established that LCN-4 notably outperforms the ConvNet-4 based State-of-the-Arts and achieves performance that is on par with or superior to most ResNet12-based methods, confirming the correctness of our conjecture. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22041v1 |

Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding (QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image information than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the performance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear kernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable classification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for image storage. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22039v1 |

Adams, Hassan Rayhan AlOmaish, Pranav Rajpurkar | We present ReXGroundingCT, the first publicly available dataset to link free-text radiology findings with pixel-level segmentations in 3D chest CT scans that is manually annotated. While prior datasets have relied on structured labels or predefined categories, ReXGroundingCT captures the full expressiveness of clinical language represented in free text and grounds it to spatially localized 3D segmentation annotations in volumetric imaging. This addresses a critical gap in medical AI: the ability to connect complex, descriptive text, such as "3 mm nodule in the left lower lobe", to its precise anatomical location in three-dimensional space, a capability essential for grounded radiology report generation systems. The dataset comprises 3,142 non-contrast chest CT scans paired with standardized radiology reports from the CT-RATE dataset. Using a systematic three-stage pipeline, GPT-4 was used to extract positive lung and pleural findings, which were then manually segmented by expert annotators. A total of 8,028 findings across 16,301 entities were annotated, with quality control performed by board-certified radiologists. Approximately 79% of findings are focal abnormalities, while 21% are non-focal. The training set includes up to three representative segmentations per finding, while the validation and test sets contain exhaustive labels for each finding entity. ReXGroundingCT establishes a new benchmark for developing and evaluating sentence-level grounding and free-text medical segmentation models in chest CT.

However, these models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy, which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale foundation models in Robotics. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22028v1 |

Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training, we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process: 1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a "Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy; and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22025v2 |

However, their application to complex cardiovascular diagnostics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present Cardiac-CLIP, a multi-modal foundation model designed for 3D cardiac CT images. Cardiac-CLIP is developed through a two-stage pre-training strategy. The first stage employs a 3D masked autoencoder (MAE) to perform self-supervised representation learning from large-scale unlabeled volumetric data, enabling the visual encoder to capture rich anatomical and contextual features. In the second stage, contrastive learning is introduced to align visual and textual representations, facilitating cross-modal understanding. To support the pre-training, we collect 16641 real clinical CT scans, supplemented by 114k publicly available data. Meanwhile, we standardize free-text radiology reports into unified templates and construct the pathology vectors according to diagnostic attributes, based on which the soft-label matrix is generated to supervise the contrastive learning process. On the other hand, to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of Cardiac-CLIP, we collect 6,722 real-clinical data from 12 independent institutions, along with the open-source data to construct the evaluation dataset. Specifically, Cardiac-CLIP is comprehensively evaluated across multiple tasks, including cardiovascular abnormality classification, information retrieval and clinical analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that Cardiac-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks in both internal and external data. Particularly, Cardiac-CLIP exhibits great effectiveness in supporting complex clinical tasks such as the prospective prediction of acute coronary syndrome, which is notoriously difficult in real-world scenarios. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22024v1 |

As one building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods, the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating meaningful explanations. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22020v1 |

Wallace, Ulas Bagci | Pancreatic cancer is projected to become the second-deadliest malignancy in Western countries by 2030, highlighting the urgent need for better early detection. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), key precursors to pancreatic cancer, are challenging to assess with current guidelines, often leading to unnecessary surgeries or missed malignancies. We present Cyst-X, an AI framework that predicts IPMN malignancy using multicenter MRI data, leveraging MRI's superior soft tissue contrast over CT. Trained on 723 T1- and 738 T2-weighted scans from 764 patients across seven institutions, our models (AUC=0.82) significantly outperform both Kyoto guidelines (AUC=0.75) and expert radiologists. The AI-derived imaging features align with known clinical markers and offer biologically meaningful insights. We also demonstrate strong performance in a federated learning setting, enabling collaborative training without sharing patient data. To promote privacy-preserving AI development and improve IPMN risk stratification, the Cyst-X dataset is released as the first large-scale, multi-center pancreatic cysts MRI dataset. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22017v1 |

It is unclear whether these objectives survive in low-resource, code-switched, and noisy multilingual settings that typify developing regions. We show they do**-**and that the choice of aggregation function becomes even more critical. Using a multilingual subset of Project Vaani spanning dozens of Indian languages and dialectal variants, we compare three contrastive objectives: (i) a global mean-pooled loss (CLIP-style), (ii) a dense max-mean token matcher (DenseAV-style), and (iii) a simple hybrid (motivated by frozen-vision alignment strategies). The dense objective delivers a +59% relative R@1 (Audio Visual) improvement over global pooling and substantially lower mean/median ranks, while consistently producing sharp zero-shot localization heatmaps of spoken objects-despite keeping the vision backbone entirely frozen (no LoRA / partial fine-tuning). Our results demonstrate that dense token routing is not a luxury of high-resource English corpora; it is more decisive when annotations and acoustic cleanliness are scarce.

However, LVLMs frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction Construction. ViHallu introduces visual variation images with controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure. These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning, allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and visual-semantic alignment.

We introduce CEDANet, a human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of 0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of 0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex, data-scarce environmental monitoring applications. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22002v1 |

Sutton, Qinghua Zhou, George Leete, Alexander N. Gorban, Ivan Y. Tyukin | We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to protect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the (unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small `trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical performance on a variety of computer vision models. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22000v1 |

Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for previously attacked unlearned concepts. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21985v1 |

However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level, facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions. Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification. Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion cues.

Despite these advantages, the task remains difficult due to two main challenges: extracting reliable features from sparse and noisy event streams, and effectively fusing them with dense, semantically rich image data that differ in structure and representation. To address these issues, we propose EIFNet, a multi-modal fusion network that combines the strengths of both event and frame-based inputs. The network includes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves event representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial attention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module (MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and integrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated fusion strategies.

Electrocardiograms (ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs. These are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area has focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent deep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most ECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge this gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to classify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method was the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual noise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform patterns. We propose a pre-processing pipeline that reduces visual noise and a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the model is first fine-tuned on synthetic and external ECG image datasets to learn domain-specific features, and then further fine-tuned on the target dataset to enhance disease-specific recognition. We adopt the ConvNeXt architecture as the backbone of our model. Our method achieved AUROC scores of 0.9688 on the public validation set and 0.9677 on the private test set of the British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge, highlighting its potential as a practical tool for automated ECG interpretation in clinical workflows. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21968v1 |

Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across various benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose information. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often requires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise. These limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such methods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline panorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic domain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a seamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that spans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different attention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while modeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose information, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This superiority is evident in both the generation of high-quality novel views and the accuracy of depth estimation, thereby showcasing its great potential for practical applications.

In specific domains like industrial smoke, acquiring such detailed annotations is particularly difficult and often requires expert knowledge. To alleviate this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has emerged as a promising approach. However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in models trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from limitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object boundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where emissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys.   Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge to mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address the model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we propose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem without relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a single network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and ViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture consistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate post-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve pseudo mask quality. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21959v1 |

Exploring intrinsic image cues, such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and contrast cues to guide the generative process.

Data-free quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored. Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose \textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ.

This task plays an important role in the automated evaluation of artistic sports such as rhythmic gymnastics and figure skating, where both accurate motion execution and temporal synchronization with background music are essential for performance assessment. However, existing methods predominantly fall into two categories: unimodal approaches that rely solely on visual features, which are inadequate for modeling multimodal cues like music; and multimodal approaches that typically employ simple feature-level contrastive fusion, overlooking deep cross-modal collaboration and temporal dynamics. As a result, they struggle to capture complex interactions between modalities and fail to accurately track critical performance changes throughout extended sequences. To address these challenges, we propose the Long-term Multimodal Attention Consistency Network (LMAC-Net). LMAC-Net introduces a multimodal attention consistency mechanism to explicitly align multimodal features, enabling stable integration of visual and audio information and enhancing feature representations. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal local query encoder module to capture temporal semantics and cross-modal relations, and use a two-level score evaluation for interpretable results. In addition, attention-based and regression-based losses are applied to jointly optimize multimodal alignment and score fusion. Experiments conducted on the RG and Fis-V datasets demonstrate that LMAC-Net significantly outperforms existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our proposed approach. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21945v1 |

However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm; 3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR) format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8% on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities.

Among these applications, fundus image analysis presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories, this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\% accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The classification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform the baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our knowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category classification on this public dataset. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21922v1 |

We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1 improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI research.

However, its potential to learn unintended demographic biases, particularly those related to social determinants of health, remains understudied. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict self-reported race from digitized dermatopathology slides and identifies potential morphological shortcuts. Using a multisite dataset with a racially diverse population, we apply an attention-based mechanism to uncover race-associated morphological features. After evaluating three dataset curation strategies to control for confounding factors, the final experiment showed that White and Black demographic groups retained high prediction performance (AUC: 0.799, 0.762), while overall performance dropped to 0.663. Attention analysis revealed the epidermis as a key predictive feature, with significant performance declines when these regions were removed. These findings highlight the need for careful data curation and bias mitigation to ensure equitable AI deployment in pathology.

Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem, their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task.

Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency, further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and immersive storytelling experiences. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21893v1 |

Accurately identifying the referent requires multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing, and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues. To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features. Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21888v1 |

Tagare, Xenophon Papademetris | Ultrasound is widely used in clinical care, yet standard deep learning methods often struggle with full video analysis due to non-standardized acquisition and operator bias. We offer a new perspective on ultrasound video analysis through implicit neural representations (INRs). We build on Functa, an INR framework in which each image is represented by a modulation vector that conditions a shared neural network. However, its extension to the temporal domain of medical videos remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose VidFuncta, a novel framework that leverages Functa to encode variable-length ultrasound videos into compact, time-resolved representations. VidFuncta disentangles each video into a static video-specific vector and a sequence of time-dependent modulation vectors, capturing both temporal dynamics and dataset-level redundancies. Our method outperforms 2D and 3D baselines on video reconstruction and enables downstream tasks to directly operate on the learned 1D modulation vectors. We validate VidFuncta on three public ultrasound video datasets -- cardiac, lung, and breast -- and evaluate its downstream performance on ejection fraction prediction, B-line detection, and breast lesion classification. These results highlight the potential of VidFuncta as a generalizable and efficient representation framework for ultrasound videos.

Existing approaches face two major challenges: temporal inconsistencies due to failure in capturing complex motion patterns, and overfitting to simple prompts arising from limitations in UNet backbone architectures. While learning-based methods can enhance editing quality, they typically demand substantial computational resources and are constrained by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this paper, we present Vid-TTA, a lightweight test-time adaptation framework that personalizes optimization for each test video during inference through self-supervised auxiliary tasks. Our approach incorporates a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism that identifies and preserves crucial movement regions, alongside a prompt perturbation and reconstruction strategy that strengthens model robustness to diverse textual descriptions. These innovations are orchestrated by a meta-learning driven dynamic loss balancing mechanism that adaptively adjusts the optimization process based on video characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vid-TTA significantly improves video temporal consistency and mitigates prompt overfitting while maintaining low computational overhead, offering a plug-and-play performance boost for existing video editing models. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21858v1 |

Existing RGB-D VSOD models have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD. Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19 state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the efficacy of SMFNet as well.

Existing methods introduce sophisticated modules, architecture-tailored designs, and excessive parameters, which impair their efficiency and applicability. We propose to extract the architecture-agnostic knowledge in heterogeneous representations by reducing the redundant architecture-exclusive information. To this end, we present a simple redundancy suppression distillation (RSD) loss, which comprises cross-architecture invariance maximisation and feature decorrelation objectives. To prevent the student from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further design a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's internal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific designs and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA. It outperforms OFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with only a fraction of their parameter overhead, which highlights its potential as a simple and strong baseline to the cross-architecture distillation community. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21844v1 |

Unlike traditional adversarial examples requiring expert knowledge, many of today's jailbreaks are low-effort, high-impact crafted by everyday users with nothing more than cleverly worded prompts. This paper presents a systems-style investigation into how non-experts reliably circumvent safety mechanisms through techniques such as multi-turn narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional impersonation, and subtle semantic edits. We propose a unified taxonomy of prompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models, grounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals that every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output validation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by highlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease with which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21820v1 |

Existing world generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and 3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D scenes from text and image conditions.

In this paper, we propose $\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence. Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment, outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50% lower training time.

However, existing models often struggle with the variability and ambiguity inherent in medical data, limiting their ability to capture nuanced clinical information and uncertainty. This work introduces an uncertainty-aware medical image-text pre-training model that enhances generalization capabilities in medical image analysis. Building on previous methods and focusing on Chest X-Rays, our approach utilizes structured text reports generated by a large language model (LLM) to augment image data with clinically relevant context. These reports begin with a definition of the disease, followed by the `appearance' section to highlight critical regions of interest, and finally `observations' and `verdicts' that ground model predictions in clinical semantics. By modeling both inter- and intra-modal uncertainty, our framework captures the inherent ambiguity in medical images and text, yielding improved representations and performance on downstream tasks.

However, existing methods often struggle with generalization to novel classes, a phenomenon attributed to overfitting on seen classes and forgetting general knowledge. Furthermore, recent approaches that improve generalization often introduce complex architectures or heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a Multiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance few-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach leverages an ensemble of parallel learnable context vectors to capture diverse semantic aspects. To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic guidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a diversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and orthogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant representations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that MSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization, achieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\% over the strong KgCoOp baseline.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level (local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a specialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This compact representation effectively empowers the LLM to perform nuanced reasoning over subtle facial muscle movements.Through extensive evaluations on the benchmark CASME II and SAMM datasets, including stringent Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain protocols, AU-LLM establishes a new state-of-the-art, validating the significant potential and robustness of LLM-based reasoning for micro-expression analysis.

While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21761v1 |

Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21756v1 |

Deep Learning (DL) has been at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance, it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias. Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22092v1 |

Aydin Alatan | Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks. Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to 128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21745v1 |

However, they inadvertently introduce category-specific semantics into the retrieval representation, creating semantic dependencies on predefined classes that critically hinder generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we propose AdvRF, a novel adversarial reconstruction feedback framework aimed at learning category-agnostic discrepancy representations. Specifically, AdvRF reformulates FGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature learning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual discrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve localization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide the reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently, the retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction model encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This representation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge distillation for efficient deployment. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our AdvRF achieves impressive performance on both widely-used fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21742v1 |

This is because the performance of large multimodal models is positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error, significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's "Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries. Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved significantly better performance compared to similar works across various evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED.

Existing methods can be roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training, showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules, including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results, and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate, their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at https://github.com/Sam1224/SAMITE. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21732v1 |

Despite rapid advancements, a substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes (DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA) layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and efficiency in critical applications. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21723v1 |

This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater scenarios. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21715v1 |

While training-based approaches address this limitation by training on high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently, training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches, which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT), a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to high-resolution image generation. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21690v1 |

This work is typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25 fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area. Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in current detection architectures.

With the advancement of deep learning, the continuous evolution of deep model architectures has driven innovation in VAD methodologies, significantly enhancing feature representation and scene adaptability, thereby improving algorithm generalization and expanding application boundaries. More importantly, the rapid development of multi-modal large language (MLLMs) and large language models (LLMs) has introduced new opportunities and challenges to the VAD field. Under the support of MLLMs and LLMs, VAD has undergone significant transformations in terms of data annotation, input modalities, model architectures, and task objectives. The surge in publications and the evolution of tasks have created an urgent need for systematic reviews of recent advancements. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey analyzing VAD methods based on MLLMs and LLMs, providing an in-depth discussion of the changes occurring in the VAD field in the era of large models and their underlying causes.

Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21627v1 |

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model (InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21619v1 |

These results suggest that, for specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific biomedical applications.

However, these box annotations require tremendous human effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named \textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations. Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker} surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively.

Existing techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process, enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging: robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a natural, controllable aging progression. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21600v1 |

The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge sharing and specificity.

Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting less influential branches.   Given the rapid development of new methods and the limitations of existing surveys in capturing recent trends, there is a pressing need for an updated and comprehensive review. Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest advancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels.   Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions for future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already familiar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their understanding of current advances and methodological innovations. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21587v1 |

Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations. This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning. We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback, TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on several key metrics. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21584v2 |

Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer, resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps, a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21573v1 |

Transformer-based methods have become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21567v1 |

Pinon Fischer, Dimitri N. Mavris | Attitude sensors determine the spacecraft attitude through the sensing of an astronomical object, field or other phenomena. The Sun and fixed stars are the two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these, sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun sensor modeling and calibration techniques. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21541v1 |

However, these defenses remain vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks. Existing jailbreak methods typically rely on direct and semantically explicit prompts, overlooking subtle vulnerabilities in how LVLMs compose information over multiple reasoning steps. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective jailbreak framework inspired by Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) techniques from software security. Our approach decomposes a harmful instruction into a sequence of individually benign visual gadgets. A carefully engineered textual prompt directs the sequence of inputs, prompting the model to integrate the benign visual gadgets through its reasoning process to produce a coherent and harmful output. This makes the malicious intent emergent and difficult to detect from any single component. We validate our method through extensive experiments on established benchmarks including SafeBench and MM-SafetyBench, targeting popular LVLMs. Results show that our approach consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines on state-of-the-art models, achieving near-perfect attack success rates (over 0.90 on SafeBench) and improving ASR by up to 0.39. Our findings reveal a critical and underexplored vulnerability that exploits the compositional reasoning abilities of LVLMs, highlighting the urgent need for defenses that secure the entire reasoning process. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21540v1 |

A promising strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules. First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type. Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21530v1 |

However, most existing works focus on generating images of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to visualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes variously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct appearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic inconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of previous step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in sequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization model, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances of ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve previously generated image patches as references, which are most related to current textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the rational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and a Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the semantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the semantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and merges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged features to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous step. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of intermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in generating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21529v1 |

We propose a differentiable loss function that promotes uncertainty calibration for effectively selecting fewer and most informative data samples for fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments across several datasets and vision backbones, we demonstrate that our solution can match and exceed the performance of complex feature-based sampling techniques while being computationally very efficient.

Cooper, Bo Zhou | For 3D spatial transcriptomics (ST), the high per-section acquisition cost of fully sampling every tissue section remains a significant challenge. Although recent approaches predict gene expression from histology images, these methods require large external datasets, which leads to high-cost and suffers from substantial domain discrepancies that lead to poor generalization on new samples. In this work, we introduce ST-DAI, a single-shot framework for 3D ST that couples a cost-efficient 2.5D sampling scheme with an intra-sample domain-adaptive imputation framework. First, in the cost-efficient 2.5D sampling stage, one reference section (central section) is fully sampled while other sections (adjacent sections) is sparsely sampled, thereby capturing volumetric context at significantly reduced experimental cost. Second, we propose a single-shot 3D imputation learning method that allows us to generate fully sampled 3D ST from this cost-efficient 2.5D ST scheme, using only sample-specific training. We observe position misalignment and domain discrepancy between sections. To address those issues, we adopt a pipeline that first aligns the central section to the adjacent section, thereafter generates dense pseudo-supervision on the central section, and then performs Fast Multi-Domain Refinement (FMDR), which adapts the network to the domain of the adjacent section while fine-tuning only a few parameters through the use of Parameter-Efficient Domain-Alignment Layers (PDLs). During this refinement, a Confidence Score Generator (CSG) reweights the pseudo-labels according to their estimated reliability, thereby directing imputation toward trustworthy regions. Our experimental results demonstrate that ST-DAI achieves gene expression prediction performance comparable to fully sampled approaches while substantially reducing the measurement burden. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21516v1 |

Current VAD methods mainly fall into two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding. Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU (Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category, semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric, which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision, overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics.

Despite substantial work investigating the trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly, especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark, consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs. Our data and code can be found at https://github.com/DSTTSD/MoHoBench. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21503v1 |

Existing methods typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set 3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images, DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at https://github.com/wangzhichuan123/DAC. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21489v1 |

However, recent developments still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain, particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field angular-temporal modeling. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21460v1 |

Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars, where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets, yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability. Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image, leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer learning performance. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21455v1 |

Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21450v1 |

In general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al \underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic \underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms, DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets, including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over previous state-of-the-art approaches.

Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries, MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution, MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous vehicles in complex environments. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21423v1 |

Existing efficiency methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging, offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE (Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be released soon. | http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21420v1 |
