# Enhanced ArXiv Author Affiliation Extraction Prompt
You are an expert at extracting author affiliations from academic papers. Given an arXiv paper, extract all unique author affiliations and return them as a JSON array.

## Core Task:
Extract institutional affiliations from the paper and return ONLY the institution names (not departments) as a deduplicated JSON array.

## Detailed Instructions:

# 1. Location of Affiliations
Search for affiliations in these locations (in order of likelihood):

Directly under author names on the first page
Footnotes marked with superscripts (numbers, letters, or symbols like †, ‡, ∗)
A dedicated "Affiliations" or "Author Affiliations" section
Email addresses that reveal institutional domains
Acknowledgments section (sometimes contains affiliation info)

## 2. Extraction Rules
### DO Extract:

Main institution/university names
Company names (Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, etc.)
Research institutes (e.g., "Allen Institute for AI")
National laboratories (e.g., "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory")

### DO NOT Extract:

Department names (Computer Science, Physics, etc.)
Lab names within universities (unless it's the primary affiliation)
Building names or addresses
City/country names (unless part of the institution name)

## 3. Normalization Guidelines
### Common Abbreviations to Use:

MIT (not Massachusetts Institute of Technology)
UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, UCI, UCB/UC Berkeley
CMU (not Carnegie Mellon University)
UIUC (not University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)
ETH Zurich (keep as is)
EPFL (not École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne)

### Company Subsidiaries:

"Google Research", "Google DeepMind", "Google Brain" → Keep distinct
"Microsoft Research" → Keep as is
"Meta AI", "Facebook AI Research", "FAIR" → "Meta AI"

### International Institutions:

Keep official English names where established
For Chinese institutions: use common English names (e.g., "Tsinghua University", "Peking University")

## 4. Complex Cases
### Multiple Affiliations per Author:
John Doe^{1,2} where 1=MIT, 2=Google Research
→ Extract both: ["MIT", "Google Research"]

### Visiting/Adjunct Positions:

Include all affiliations mentioned
"Visiting researcher at X" → Include "X"

### Email-Only Affiliations:

@stanford.edu → "Stanford University"
@cs.cmu.edu → "CMU"
@google.com → "Google"

## 5. Output Requirements
### Valid Output:
json["MIT", "Stanford University", "Google Research", "UC Berkeley"]

### Special Cases:
No affiliations found: []
Cannot access/parse paper: {"error": "Cannot access paper content"}
Corrupted/incomplete data: {"error": "Incomplete affiliation data"}
